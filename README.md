# Procreate Swatches Generator (From Hex)

This is a tool for translating HEX colors into Procreate swatches files.
It's particularly useful when people share a list of colors of their artwork.


The code is mostly GPT generated, so please don't judge the code quality... I was in a hurry :/

It's also inspired by this repo (thx!): https://github.com/szydlovski/procreate-swatches
